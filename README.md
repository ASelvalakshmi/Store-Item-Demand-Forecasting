## Project Description

The project works with a dataset obtained from a Kaggle competition, consisting of 5 years of store-item sales data. Our goal is to predict the sales of 50 different items at 10 different stores for a period of 3 months. In this kind of time series forecasting problem, using a powerful gradient boosting algorithm like LightGBM can yield successful results.
The dataset has been preprocessed, and missing data has been handled.
